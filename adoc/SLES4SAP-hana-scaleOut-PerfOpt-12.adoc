== About This Guide

=== Introduction

{sles4sapReg} is optimized in various
ways for SAP* applications. This guide provides detailed information about
installing and customizing _{sles4sap}_
for {saphana} Scale-Out system replication automation in the performance
optimized scenario.

High availability is an important aspect of running your mission-critical
{saphana} servers.

The {saphana} Scale-Out system replication is a replication of all data in
{saphana} to a second {saphana} system. The {saphana} itself replicates all of
its data to a secondary {saphana} instance. This is an out-of-the-box, standard
feature.

The recovery time objective (RTO) is minimized through the data replication at
regular intervals. {saphana} supports asynchronous and synchronous modes. We
describe here the synchronous replication from memory into memory of the second
system, because it is the only method which allows the cluster taking
descision on based on coded algorythms.

=== Additional Documentation and Resources

Chapters in this manual contain links to additional documentation resources that
are either available on the system or on the Internet.

For the latest documentation updates, see http://www.suse.com/documentation.

You can also find numerous white-papers, best-practices guides, and other
resources at the {sles4sap} resource library:

== Scope of this Documentation
This document describes how to set up an automation of a {saphana} Scale-Out
system replication cluster installed on two sites based on {sles4sap} 12 SP2.
This concept could also be used with {sles4sap} 12 SP3 or newer.

To give a better overview the installation and setup is separated into
seven steps.

- Planning (section <<Planning>>)
- OS setup (section <<OsSetup>>)
- {saphana} installation (section <<SAPHanaInst>>)
- {saphana} system replication configuration (section <<SAPHanaHsr>>)
- {saphana} cluster integration (section <<Integration>>)
- {sles4sapAbbr} cluster configuration (section <<Cluster>>)
- Testing (section <<Testing>>)

As the result of the setup process you will have a {sles4sapAbbr} cluster controlling
two 'swarms' of {saphana} scale-out in system replication configuration. The architecture
is named the 'performance optimized scenario'.

What you need before you start:
// TODO PRIO3: (all) should we change from NFS to someting more neutral in the following list like replacing 'NFS storage pools' by 'SAP HANA certified storage pools'?

- Software from {suse}: {sles4sap} installation media and a valid subscription
  for getting updates
- Software from {sap}: {saphana} installation media
- Physical or virtual systems including disks and NFS storage pools (see below)
- Filled parameter sheet (see below)

=== Minimum Lab Requirements and Prerequisites

This section defines some minimum requirements to install {saphana} scale-out.


NOTE: The minimum lab requirements mentioned here are no SAP sizing information.
These data are only to rebuild the described cluster in a lab for test purposes.
Even for such tests the requirements could increase depending on your test scenario.
For productive system please ask your hardware vendor or use official SAP sizing
tools and services.

NOTE: Please refer to {saphana} TDI documentation for allowed storage
configuration and filesystems.

- 1 VM with 2GB RAM, 50GB disk space
- 1 shared disk for SBD with 10 MB disk space
- 2 NFS pools (one per site) with a capacity of each 96GB
- 1 additional IP address for takeover

// DONE PRIO1: (FH) PICTURE FOR SECOND SETUP (3+2: 3+2)

.Simplified NFS share structure of a 3+2:3+2 {saphana} system replication

The requirements with 5 {SAPHANA} instances per site (3+2 : 3+2) -
with a majority maker:

- 10 VMs with each 32GB RAM, 50GB disk space
- 1 VM with 2GB RAM, 50GB disk space
- 1 shared disk for SBD with 10 MB disk space
- 2 NFS pools (one per site) with a capacity of each 132GB
- 1 additional IP address for takeover

// pools size is calculated like:
//     shared = 1 * MEM
//     data   = NODES * 1   * MEM
//     log    =  NODES * 1/2 * MEM
//     pool = shared + data + log

// DONE PRIO1: Table with parameter sheet

//For the SBD based fecing the setup needs a pool (1 up to 3) of shared
//disks to allow the transportation of the "posion pills".

The SBD based fencing needs up to 3 shared block devices.

.Additionally to the NFS shares: All cluster nodes need to have access to the SBD block devices

=== Parameter Sheet

The cluster organizing two {saphana} 'swarms' is quite complex. The installation
should be planned properly. You should have all needed parameters like SID, IP
addresses and much more already in place. It is a good practice to first fill-out
the parameter sheet and then begin with the installation.

=== Scale-Out Scenario and Resource Agents

To automate the fail-over, we are is using the HA Extension build into
_{sles4sap}_ and we created two resource agents to handle the scenario.

One is the *SAPHanaController* resource agent (RA), which actual checks and
manages the {saphana} database instances. This RA is configured as a
master/slave resource.

The master assumes responsibility for the active master name server of the
{saphana} database running in primary mode, and all other instances are
represented by the slave mode.

.Cluster resource agents and master/slave status mapping
image::SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut-Cluster-Resources02.svg[scaledwidth="100%"]

The second RA is to make configuring the cluster as simple as possible.
The *SAPHanaTopology* resource agent runs on all nodes (beside the majority maker)
of an {sle} 12 HAE cluster and gathers information about the statuses and
configurations of the {saphana} system replication. It is designed as a normal
(stateless) clone resource.

{SAPHANA} system replication for Scale-Out is supported in the following
scenarios or use cases:

Performance optimized, single container (A > B)::
This scenario and setup is described in this document. In the performance
optimized scenario a {saphana} RDBMS on site "A" is synchronizing with a
{saphana} RDBMS on a second site "B". As the {saphana} RDBMS on the second site
is configured to preload the tables the takeover time is typically very short.

////
TO BE ADDED LATER, AFTER WE WILL HOPEFULLY GET A SOULTION FOR THAT
Cost optimized (A > B, Q)::
This scenario and setup is described in an other document in the resource
library ( {reslibrary} ) for on-premise systems. It can be adopted to Azure too.
In the cost optimized scenario the second node is also used for a non-productive
{saphana} RDBMS system (like QAS or TST). Whenever a takeover is needed the
non-productive system must be stopped first. As the productive secondary system
on this node must be limited in using system resources, the table preload must
be switched off and a possible takeover needs longer than in the performance
optimized use case.

Multi Tier (A > B -> C)::
This scenario and setup is described in an other document in the resource
library ( {reslibrary} ) for on-premise systems. It can be adopted to Azure
too.. A Multi Tier system replication has an additional target, which must be
connected to the secondary (chain topology).
////

Performance optimized, multi-tenancy also named MDC (%A > %B)::
Multi-tenancy is supported for all above scenarios and use cases. This scenario
is supported since {SAPHANA} 1 SPS12. The setup and configuration from cluster
point of view is the same for multi-tenancy and single container, so you can use
the above documents for both kinds of scenarios.

Multi-tenancy is the default installation type for {SAPHANA} 2.0.

=== The Concept of the Performance Optimized Scenario

In case of failure of the primary {saphana} on site 1 the cluster first tries to
start the takeover process. This allows to use the already loaded data at the
secondary site. Typically the takeover is much faster than the local restart.

A site is noticed as "down" or "on error", if the *LandscapeHostConfiguration
status* reflects this (return code 1). This happens, if worker nodes are going
down without any {SAPHANA} standby nodes left, which could perform an auto host
fail-over of the worker functionality.

Without any additional intervention the resource agent will wait for the {sap}
internal HA cluster to repair the situation locally. An additional intervention
could be a custom python hook using the SAP provider srServiceStateChanged()
available since {SAPHANA} 2.0 SPS01.

To achieve an automation of this resource handling process, we can utilize the
{SAPHANA} resource agents included in SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut rpm package delivered with
{sles4sapReg}.

You can configure the level of automation by setting the parameter
*AUTOMATED_REGISTER*. If automated registration is activated the cluster will
also automatically register a former failed primary to get the new secondary.

=== Important Prerequisites

Please read the SAP Notes and papers first.

With the _SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut_ resource agent software package, we
support Scale-Out (multiple-box to multiple-box) system replication with the
following configurations and parameters:

* The cluster must include a valid STONITH method.
* As the STONITH mechanism we recommend SBD.
* Both sites are either in the same network segment (layer 2) to allow an easy
  takeover of an IP Address or you need a technique like overlay IP addresses in
  virtual private clouds.
* Technical users and groups, such as _{refsidadm}_ are defined *locally* in the
  Linux system.
* Name resolution of the cluster nodes and the virtual IP address should be done
  *locally* on *all* cluster nodes in order not depending on DNS services (as it
  can fail too).
* Time synchronization between the cluster nodes using reliable time services
  like NTP.
* Both {saphana} sites have the same SAP Identifier (SID) and instance number.
* The {SAPHANA} scale-out system must only have one active master name server per
  site and should have up to three master name server candidates ({SAPHANA}
  nodes with a configured role 'master<N>').
* The {SAPHANA} scale-out system must only have one fail-over group.
* The cluster described in this document does not manage any service IP address
  for a read-enabled secondary site.
* There is only one {saphana} system replication like from site A to site B but no
  third site C (also called multi-tier or multi-target).
* The setup implements the performance optimized scenario but not the cost
  optimized scenario.
* The {sapHostAgent} must be running. {sapHostAgent} is needed to translate bewtween
  the system node names and sap hostnames used during the installation of {saphana}.
* The replication mode should be either 'sync' or 'syncmem'.
* All {saphana} instances controlled by the cluster must not be activated via
  sapinit autostart.

[CAUTION]
====
Automated registration of a failed primary after takeover is possible, but as a
good starting configuration for projects, we recommend to *switch off* the
automated registration of a failed primary, therefore the
_AUTOMATED_REGISTER="false"_ is the *default*.

In this case, you need to register a failed primary after a takeover manually.
Use SAP tools like *hanastudio* or *hdbnsutil*.
// TODO PRIO3: Should we add also hana  cockpit here?
====

* For optimal automation, we recommend AUTOMATED_REGISTER="true".
* Automated start of {SAPHANA} instances during system boot must be switched
  *off*.
* You need at least SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut version 0.161, {sles4sap} 12 SP2 and
  {SAPHANA} 1.0 SPS12 (121) or {SAPHANA} 2.0 SPS 2 for all mentioned setups.

IMPORTANT: You must implement a valid STONITH method. Without a valid STONITH
method, the complete cluster is unsupported and will not work properly.

This setup-guide focuses on the performance optimized setup as it is the
one-and-only supported scenario at the point of writing this guide.

If you need to implement a different scenario, we strongly recommend to define
a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) with {SUSE}. This PoC will focus on testing the existing
solution in your scenario. The limitation of most of the above items is mostly
due to testing limits.

== Operating System Setup

[[OsSetup]] This section includes information you should consider during the
installation if the operating system.

In this document we first install and configure the {sles4sapAbbr}. Than we set up the {saphana}
database including the system replication. As last we last set up and configure the
automation with the cluster.

=== Installing {sles4sap}

There are multiple installation guides already existing and many other reasons are available
to set up the server in a certain way. We would like to outline where the information can be found.
We will show you important points to get a system which is well prepared to deliver {sapHana}.

==== Install Base Operating System

Depending on your infrastructure and hardware which is used, you have to adapt the installation.
All supported installation methods and minimum requirement are described in our _Deployment Guide_
(https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-12/book_sle_deployment/data/book_sle_deployment.html).
In case of automated installations you can find further information in our _AutoYaST Guide_
(https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-12/book_autoyast/data/book_autoyast.html).
The major installation guide for {sles4sapAbbr} to fit all requirements for {sapHana} is described at
SAP note:

// SUSE and SAP are keept literal here not by the reference, because its a quote of an external title
- 1984787 SUSE LINUX Enterprise Server 12: Installation notes and
- 2205917 SAP HANA DB: Recommended OS settings for SLES 12 / SLES for SAP Applications 12.


==== Install Additional Software
{SUSE} deliver with {sles4sapAbbr} special resource agents for {sapHana}. With the pattern sap-hana the resource
agent for {sapHana} ScaleUP is installed. For the ScaleOut scenario we need a special resource agent.
Please follow these instructions on each node if you have installed the systems based on SAP note 1984787.
The pattern _High Availability_ summarizes all tools what we recommend to install on *all* nodes including the
majority maker.

* remove package: patterns-sap-hana, {sapHanaSR}, yast2-sap-ha
* install package: {sapHanaSR}-ScaleOut, {sapHanaSR}-ScaleOut-doc
* install pattern: ha_sles

To do so, for example, use zypper:

// SUSE is kept litera here, because it is a quote from a command output

=== Configure {sles4sapAbbr} to run {sapHana}

==== Tuning / Modification
All needed operating system tuning requirements are described in SAP-note 2205917. The SAP note
point to a tool which can help you to take care for some of the settings. We recommend
to manually verify each parameter which is mentioned in the SAP note.
This should ensure all performance settings for your
{sapHana} are done.

[subs="quotes,attributes"]

The SAP note covers:

- SLES 12 GA (no SP) and SLES 12 SP1 Linux kernel upgrade
- SLES 12 SP2 Linux kernel upgrade
- SLES12 SP3 Linux kernel upgrade
- Additional 3rd-party kernel modules
- Configure tuned to use profile "sap-hana" (applies to Intel-based systems only)
- Turn off NUMA balancing
- Disable transparent hugepages
- Configure C-States for lower latency in Linux (applies to Intel-based systems only)

- Energy Performance Bias (EPB, applies to Intel-based systems only)
- Turn off kernel samepage merging (KSM)
- Linux Pagecache Limit


==== Enable ssh Access via Public Key (optional)
Public key authentication provides SSH users access to their servers without entering their passwords.
SSH keys are also more secure than passwords, because the private key used to secure the connection
is never shared. Private keys can also be encrypted. So their contents can’t be read as easily.
We have decided to use a very simple but useful setup for this documentation. This setup is based on
only one ssh-key pair which enables ssh access to all cluster nodes.

INFO: Please follow your company security policy to set up access to the systems.

.SSH key creation and exchange
====
As user root create an ssh key on one node.

----
ssh-keygen -t rsa
----

The ssh-key generation ask for missing parameters.

----

After the _ssh-keygen_ is set up, you will have two new files under _/root/.ssh/_ .

----
ls /root/.ssh/

----

Collect the public host keys from all other node. We have used the _ssh-keyscan_ comand.

----
ssh-keyscan
----

The ssh host key is automatically collected and stored in the file _/root/.ssh/known_host_ during the first ssh
connection. To avoid to confirm the first login with "yes" which accept the host key, we collect and store
them beforehand.

----
ssh-keyscan -t ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 <host1>,<host1 ip> >>.ssh/known_hosts
ssh-keyscan -t ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 <host2>,<host2 ip> >>.ssh/known_hosts
ssh-keyscan -t ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 <host3>,<host3 ip> >>.ssh/known_hosts
...
----

After collecting all host keys we store them in a file named _authorized_keys_. We push the complete
directory /root/.ssh/ form the first node to all further cluster members.

==== Set up Disk Layout for {sapHana}

We generally recommend a SAP certified storage system with a validated storage
API. This is in general a prerequisite of a stable and reliable Scale-Out installation.

The default path to the log directory depends on the system ID of the {SAPHANA}
host.

/hana/data/{refSID}::
The default path to the data directory depends on the system ID of the {SAPHANA}
host.

/usr/sap::
This is the path to the local SAP system instance directories. It is possible
to join this location with the Linux installation.

/sapsoftware:: (optional)
Space for copying the SAP install software media. This NFS pool is mounted on both sites and contains
the {sapHana} installation media and installation parameter files.

Set up host name resolution for all machines.

You can either use a DNS server or modify the _/etc/hosts_ on *all* nodes.

With maintaining the _/etc/hosts_ file, you minimize the impact of a failing
DNS service. Replace the IP address and the host name in the following commands.

[subs="quotes,attributes"]
----
vi /etc/hosts
----

Insert the following lines to _/etc/hosts_. Change the IP address and host name
to match your environment.

[subs="quotes,attributes"]
----
**_{HostIP1}**_ _**{mySite1FirstNode}**_
**_{HostIP2}**_ _**{mySite2FirstNode}**_
...

Enable NTP service on all nodes.

Simply enable an *ntp service* on all node in the cluster to have proper time
synchronization.

== Installing the {saphana} Databases on both sites
[[SAPHanaInst]] As now the infrastructure is set up, we can install the {saphana} database on
both sites. In a cluster a machine is also called a _node_.

.<<Planning>> <<OsSetup>> SAPHanaInst <<SAPHanaHsr>> <<Integration>> <<Cluster>> <<Testing>>
image::SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut-Plan-Phase3.svg[scaledwidth="100%"]

In our example here and to make it more easy to follow the documentation, we
name the machines (or nodes) _{mySite1FirstNode}_, ... _suseXX_. The nodes with odd numbers
(suse01, suse03, suse05, ...) will be part of site "A" ({mySite1Name}) and the nodes with even
(suse02, suse04, suse06, ...) will be part of site "B"({mySite2Name}) .

The following users are automatically created during the {saphana} installation:

{refsidadm}::
The user{refsidadm} is the operating system user required for administrative
tasks, such as starting and stopping the system.
sapadm::
The SAP Host Agent  administrator.
SYSTEM::
The {saphana} database superuser

// TODO PRIO3: Add also groups?

=== Preparation
- Read the SAP Installation and Setup Manuals available at the SAP Marketplace.

- Download the {SAPHANA} Software from SAP Marketplace.

- Mount the file systems to install {SAPHANA} database software and database
  content (data and log).

=== Installation

    ssh $system mount -a
done
----
+
. Install the {saphana} Database as described in the {SAPHANA} Server
Installation Guide on *all* machines (two sites) except the majority maker.
Both databases need to have same SID and instance number.
You can use either the graphical
user interface of the command line installer _hdblcm_. The command line installer
could be used in an interactive or batch mode. 
// TODO PRIO3: Use an answer file instead or provide it in the appendix
+
.Using hdblcm in interactive mode
==============================
----
# <path_to_sap_media>/hdblcm
----
==============================
+
Alternatively you could also use the batch mode of hdblcm. This can either be
done by specifying all needed parameters via the command line or by using a
parameter file.
+
In our case we decided to use the command line parameters. In the batch mode you
need provide a XML password file (here <path>/hana_passwords). A tempalte of this
password file can be created with the following command:
+
.Creating a password file
==========
[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
<path_to_sap_media>/hdblcm --dump_configfile_template=templateFile
----
==========
+
This command creates two files _templateFile_ is the template for a parameter
file and _templateFile.xml_ is the XML template to provide several hana_passwords
to the hdblcm installer.
+
The XML password file looks like:
+
.The XML password template

</Passwords>
----
===========

After we have created the XML password file, we could immediately start the
{saphana} installation in the batch mode by providing all needed parameters at
the command line.

== Set up the {SAPHANA} System Replication
[[SAPHanaHsr]] This section describes the setup of the system replication (HSR) after {saphana} has
been installed properly.

**Procedure**

. Back up the primary database
. Enable primary database
. Register the secondary database
. Verify the system replication

.<<Planning>> <<OsSetup>> <<SAPHanaInst>> SAPHanaHsr <<Integration>> <<Cluster>> <<Testing>>
image::SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut-Plan-Phase4.svg[scaledwidth="100%"]

For more information read the Section _Setting Up System Replication_ of the
{saphana} Administration Guide.

=== Back Up the Primary Database
Please, first back up the primary database as described in the
_{saphana} Administration Guide, Section {saphana} Database Backup and Recovery_.

We provide some examples to back up {saphana} with SQL Commands:

.Simple backup for the system database and all tenants with one singe backup call
=========================
As user {refsidadm} enter the following command:

----
hdbsql -u SYSTEM -d SYSTEMDB \
   "BACKUP DATA FOR FULL SYSTEM USING FILE ('backup')"
----

You get the following command output (or similar):

----
0 rows affected (overall time 15.352069 sec; server time 15.347745 sec)
----
=========================

.Simple backup for a single container (non MDC) database
=========================
Please enter the following command as user {refsidadm}:

[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
hdbsql -i {refInst} -u <dbuser> \
   "BACKUP DATA USING FILE ('backup')"
----
=========================

////
.Back up the system database only
=========================
----
hdbsql -i <inst> -u <dbuser> -d SYSTEMDB \
   "BACKUP DATA ALL USING FILE ('<path>')"
----
=========================

.Back up a tenant using a systemdb database user
=========================
----
hdbsql -i <instnr> -u <dbuser> -d SYSTEMDB \
   "BACKUP DATA FOR <DBNAME> USING FILE ('<path>')"
----
=========================

.Back up the tenant using a tenant database user
=========================
----
hdbsql -i <instnr> -u <dbuser> -d <tenantDBNAME> \
   "BACKUP DATA USING FILE ('<path>’)”
----

=========================
////

////
If you have (for example) created a backup database user and a user key
_hanabackup_, you can create an initial backup of an MDC {SAPHANA} using the
following command:

----
hdbsql -U hanabackup \
   "BACKUP DATA FOR FULL SYSTEM USING FILE ('backup')"
----
////

IMPORTANT: Without a valid backup, you *cannot* bring {SAPHANA} into a system
replication configuration.

// TODO PRIO3: (BS) Add section about separate SR network. Only a hint not a
//    complete setup

=== Enable Primary Database
As Linux user _{refsidadm}_ enable the system replication at the primary node. You
need to define a site name (like _{mySite1Name}_) which must be unique for all {SAPHANA}
databases which are connected via system replication. This means the secondary
must have a different site name.

.Enable the system replication on the primary site
==========
As user {refsidadm} enable the primary:

[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
hdbnsutil -sr_enable --name={mySite1Name}
----

Check, if the command output is similar to:
// DONE PRIO2: (all) Check if the following output is valid:

[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
nameserver is active, proceeding ...
successfully enabled system as system replication source site
done.
----
==========

The command line tool _hdbnsutil_ can be used to check the system replication
mode and site name.

.Check the system replication configuration status as user {refsidadm} on the primary
==========
[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
hdbnsutil -sr_stateConfiguration
----

If the system replication enablement was successful at the primary, the
output should look like:
// DONE PRIO2: (all) Check if the following output is valid:

[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
checking for active or inactive nameserver ...
System Replication State
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

mode: primary
site id: 1
site name: {mySite1Name}
done.
----
==========

The mode has changed from “none” to “primary” and the site now has a site name
and a site ID.

=== Register the Secondary Database
The {saphana} database instance on the secondary side must be stopped before the
system can be registered for the system replication. You can use your
preferred method to stop the instance (like _HDB_ or _sapcontrol_). After the
database instance has been stopped successfully, you can register the instance
using _hdbnsutil_.

.Stop the secondary as Linux user _{refsidadm}_:
==========
[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
sapcontrol -nr {refInst} -function StopSystem
----
==========

// TODO PRIO3: Any need to adapt the following files be be "neutral" and not
// bound to a specific site or hostname? We need at least to change files for
// the XSA (see SAP Note xxxx)
// The files are in binary format but include the name 'suse01' (of the primary)

.Copy the KEY and KEY-DATA file from the primary to the secondary site
==========
The copy of key and key-data should only be done on the master name server.
As the files are in the global file space you do not need to run the comamnd
on all cluster nodes.

[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
cd /usr/sap/{refSID}/SYS/global/security/rsecssfs
rsync -va {,<node1-siteB>:}$PWD/data/SSFS_{refSID}.DAT
rsync -va {,<node1-siteB>:}$PWD/key/SSFS_{refSID}.KEY
----
==========

// rsync -va {,suse02:}/usr/sap/HA1/SYS/global/security/rsecssfs/data/SSFS_HA1.DAT
// rsync -va {,suse02:}/usr/sap/HA1/SYS/global/security/rsecssfs/key/SSFS_HA1.KEY

.Register the secondary as Linux user _{refsidadm}_:
==========
[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
hdbnsutil -sr_register --name=<site2> \
     --remoteHost=<node1-siteA> --remoteInstance={refInst} \
     --replicationMode=sync --operationMode=logreplay
----

// DONE PRIO2: (all) Check if the following output is valid:
[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
adding site ...
checking for inactive nameserver ...
nameserver {mySite2FirstNode}:30001 not responding.
collecting information ...
updating local ini files ...
done.
----
==========

The _remoteHost_ is the primary node in our case, the _remoteInstance_ is the
database instance number (here {myHANAInst}).

Now start the database instance again and verify the system replication status.
On the secondary site, the mode should be one of „SYNC“, „SYNCMEM“ or „ASYNC“.
The mode depends on the sync option defined during the registration of the
secondary.

.Start the system on the secondary site as user {refsidadm}
==========
[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
sapcontrol -nr {refInst} -function StartSystem
----

Wait till the {sapHana} database is started completely.
==========

.Check the system replication configuration as Linux user {refsidadm}
==========
[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
hdbnsutil -sr_stateConfiguration
----

The output should look like:

[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
System Replication State
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
mode: sync
site id: 2
site name: {mySite2Name}
active primary site: 1

primary masters: {suse01} {suse03} {suse05}
done.
----
==========


=== Verify the System Replication

To view the replication state of the whole {saphana} cluster, use the following
command as _{refsidadm}_ user on the primary site.

.Check the system replication status at the primaty site (as {refsidadm})
=========
[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----

== Integration of {sapHana} with the Cluster

.<<Planning>> <<OsSetup>> <<SAPHanaInst>> <<SAPHanaHsr>> Integration <<Cluster>> <<Testing>>
image::SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut-Plan-Phase5.svg[scaledwidth="100%"]

[[Integration]] We need to proceed the following steps:

**Procedure**

. Implement the python hook SAPHanaSR
. Configure system replication operation mode
. Allow {refsidadm} to access the cluster
. Start {saphana}
. Test the hook integration

=== Implement the Python Hook SAPHanaSR

This step must be done on both sites. {SAPHANA} must be stopped to change the
global.ini and allow {SAPHANA} to integrate the HA/DR hook script during start.

- Install the HA/DR hook script into a read/writable directory
- Integrate the hook into global.ini ({saphana} needs to be stopped for doing that offline)
- Check integration of the hook during startup

Take the hook from the SAPHanaSR-scaleOut package and copy it to your preferred
directory like /hana/share/myHooks

[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
{mySite1FirstNode}~ # mkdir -p /hana/shared/myHooks
{mySite1FirstNode}~ # cp /usr/share/SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut/SAPHanaSR.py /hana/shared/myHooks
{mySite1FirstNode}~ # chown -R {refsidadm}:sapsys /hana/shared/myHooks
----

Stop {SAPHANA}

[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----

----

.Adding SAPHanaSR via global.ini
===================================
----
[ha_dr_provider_SAPHanaSR]
provider = SAPHanaSR
path = /hana/shared/myHooks
execution_order = 1

[trace]
ha_dr_saphanasr = info
----
===================================

=== Configure System Replication Operation Mode

Once your system is connected as a {sapHanaSR} target you can find an entry in the _global.ini_
which defines the operation mode. Up to now there are two modes available.

* _delta_datashipping_
* _logreplay_

Until a takeover and re-registration in the opposite direction the entry for the operation mode is missing on
your primary site. The "classic" operation mode is delta_datashipping. The preferred mode for HA is
_logreplay_. Using the operation mode logreplay makes your secondary site in the {saphana}
system replication a HotStandby system.
For more details regarding both modes please check SAP documentation like
"How To Perform System Replication for SAP HANA ".

Please check both _global.ini_ files and add the operation mode, if needed.

section:: [ system_replication ]
key:: operation_mode = logreplay

Path for the _global.ini_: /hana/shared/<SID>/global/hdb/custom/config/
----
[system_replication]
operation_mode = logreplay
----

=== Allow {refsidadm} to access the Cluster

The current version of the SAPHanaSR python hook uses the command 'sudo' to allow
the {refsidadm} user to access the cluster attributes. In Linux you can use 'visudo'
to start the vi editor for the '/etc/sudoers' configuration file.

The user {refsidadm} must be able to set the cluster attribute hana_{refsidLC}_glob_srHook.
The {SAPHANA} system replication hook needs password free access. The following
example limits the sudo access to exactly setting the needed attribute.

Replace the {refsidLC} by the lowercase SAP system ID.

.Entry in sudo permissions /etc/sudoers file
===================================
Basic parameter option to allow <sidadm> to use the srHook.

. Final steps

=== Installation of Cluster Packages

If not already done, install the pattern _High Availability_ on *all* nodes.

To do so, for example, use zypper:
----
zypper in -t pattern ha_sles
----

Now the Resource Agents for controlling the {saphana} system replication need
to be installed at *all* cluster nodes, including the majority maker.
----
zypper in SAPHanaSR-scaleOut
----

If you have the packages installed before, make sure to get the newest updates
on *all* nodes
----
zypper patch

=== Basic Cluster Configuration

// DONE PRIO1: (FH) Text (basic cluster configuration)

The first step is to set up the basic cluster framework. For convenience, use
YaST2 or the _ha-cluster-init_ script.

[IMPORTANT]
It is strongly recommended to add a second corosync ring, implement unicast (UCAST)
communication and adjust the timeout values to your environment.

**Prerequisites**

* Name resolution
* Time sychronisation
* Redundant network for cluster intercommunication
* STONITH method

==== Set up Watchdog for "Storage-based Fencing"
We recommend and use SBD as central stonith device in our example. Each node constantly monitors
connectivity to the storage device, and terminates itself in case the partition becomes unreachable.
Whenever SBD is used, a
correctly working watchdog is crucial. Modern systems support a hardware watchdog that needs to
be "tickled" or "fed" by a software component. The software component (usually a daemon) regularly
writes a service pulse to the watchdog—if the daemon stops feeding the watchdog, the hardware will
enforce a system restart. This protects against failures of the SBD process itself, such as dying, or
becoming stuck on an IO error.

.Set up for Watchdog
====
IMPORTANT: Access to the Watchdog Timer:
No other software must access the watchdog timer. Some hardware vendors ship systems management
software that uses the watchdog for system resets (for example, HP ASR daemon). Disable such
software, if watchdog is used by SBD.

Determine the right watchdog module. Alternatively, you can find a list of installed drivers with your
kernel version.

----
ls -l /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/drivers/watchdog
----

Check if any watchdog module is already loaded.

----
lsmod | egrep "(wd|dog|i6|iT|ibm)"
----

If you get a result, the system has already a loaded watchdog. If the watchdog does not match
your watchdog device you need to unload the module.

To safely unload the module we first check, if an application is using the watchdog device.

----
lsof /dev/watchdog
rmmod <wrong_module>
----

Enable your watchdog module and make it persistent. We have used the _softdog_ which has some
restrictions and should not be used as first option.

----
echo softdog > /etc/modules-load.d/watchdog.conf
systemctl restart systemd-modules-load
----

Check if the watchdog module is loaded correctly.

----
lsmod | grep dog
----

Testing the watchdog can be done with a simple action. Take care to switch of your {sapHana}
first because the watchdog will force a unclean reset / shutdown of your system.

In case of a hardware watchdog a desired action is predefined after the timeout of the watchdog has
reached. If your watchdog module is loaded and not controlled by any other application do the following.

IMPORTANT: Trigger the watchdog without continiously updating the watchdog does reset/switchoff the system.
      This is the intended mechanism. The following commands will force your system to be reset/switched off.

----
touch /dev/watchdog
----

In case of the softdog module is used the following can be done.

----
echo 1> /dev/watchdog
----

After your test was successful you can implement the watchdog on all cluster members. Our example
is for the softdog module. Replace **<wrong_module>** by the module name queried before.

----
for i in suse{02,03,04,05,06,-mm}; do
    ssh -T $i <<EOSSH
        hostname
        rmmod <wrong_module>
        echo softdog > /etc/modules-load.d/watchdog.conf
        systemctl restart systemd-modules-load
        lsmod |grep -e dog
EOSSH
done

// DONE PRIO2: check unicast
==== Initial Cluster setup using ha-cluster-init
For more detailed information about ha-cluster-* tools, see _Overview of the Bootstrap Scripts_ in  https://www.suse.com/documentation/sle_ha/
// DONE PRIO2: (FH) link missing ↑{sleha}.

// DONE PRIO2: Describe the procedure with option "-u" for creating a unicast config

Create an initial setup by using _ha-cluster-init_ command. Follow the dialog
steps.

NOTE: This is *only* to be done on the *first* cluster node. If you are using
SBD as STONITH mechanism, you need first to load the watchdog kernel module
matching your setup. In our case we use the _softdog_ kernel module.


The command _ha_cluster-init_ configures the basic cluster framework including:

* ssh keys
* csync2 to transfer configuration files
* SBD (at least one device)
* corosync (at least one ring)
* HAWK web interface

// DONE PRIO2: describe the init with option -u?


[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
ha-cluster-init -u -s <sbd-device>
----

As requested by _ha-cluster-init_, change the password of the user _hacluster_ on all cluster nodes.

NOTE: Do not forget to change the password of the user _hacluster_.

==== Cluster Configuration for all other Cluster Nodes
The other nodes of the cluster could be integrated by starting the
command _ha-cluster-join_. This command just asks for the IP address or name of
the *first* cluster node. Than all needed configuration files are copied over.
As a result the cluster is started on *all* nodes. Do not forget the majority maker.

If you are using SBD as STONITH method you need to activate the _softdog_ kernel
module matching your systems. In our case we use the _softdog_ kernel module.

[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
ha-cluster-join -c {refHost1}
----

==== Check the Cluster for the first Time
Now it is time to check and optionally start the cluster for the first time on
all nodes.

NOTE: All nodes should be started in parallel. Otherwise unseen nodes might get fenced.

Check the cluster status with _crm_mon_. We use the option "-r" to also see
resources, which are configured but stopped.
----
crm_mon -r
----

The command will show the "empty" cluster and will print something like the
following screen output. The most interesting information for now is that
there are two nodes in the status "online" and the message "partition with quorum".

=== Configure Cluster Properties and Resources
This section describes how to configure bootstrap, STONITH, resources, and constraints
using the _crm_ configure shell command as described in section
_Configuring and Managing Cluster Resources_ (Command Line),
{sleha}.

We use the command _crm_ to add the objects to the Cluster Resource Management
(CRM). Copy the following examples to a local file and than load the
configuration to the Cluster Information Base (CIB). The benefit is here that
you have a scripted setup and a backup of your configuration.

We do all _crm_ commands only on *one* node, for example on machine {mySite1FirstNode}

First we write a text file with the configuration, which we load into our cluster
in a second step. This would look like:

[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
vi crm-file<XX>
crm configure load update crm-file<XX>
----

==== Cluster Bootstrap and more
The first example defines the cluster bootstrap options including the resource and
operation defaults.

// DONE PRIO2: check for azure
The stonith-timeout should be greater than 1.2 times the SBD msgwait timeout.

[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
vi crm-bs.txt
----

Enter the following to crm-bs.txt

// NOTE: DONE PRIO1: - check the validity of the configuration (boot-strap)

----
property $id="cib-bootstrap-options" \
              no-quorum-policy="freeze" \
              stonith-enabled="true" \
              stonith-action="reboot" \
              stonith-timeout="150s"
              rsc_defaults $id="rsc-options" \

              migration-threshold="5"
op_defaults $id="op-options" \
              timeout="600"
----

Now we add the configuration to the cluster.

[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
crm configure load update crm-bs.txt

==== STONITH

As already written in the requirements, STONITH is crucial for a supported cluster setup.
Without a valid fencing mechanism your cluster is unsupported.

As standard STONITH mechanism we impelemnt SBD based fencing. The SBD STONITH method is
very stable, relaible and has proved very good road capability.

You can use other fencing methods avaialble e.g. by your public cloud provider.
However, intensive testing the server fencing is crucial.

For SBD based fencing you could use one up to three SBD devices. The cluster will react differently
when a SBD device is lost. The differences and SBD fencing are explained very well in the {SUSE}
product documentation of {sleha} available at {productdocu}.

We have to adapt the SBD resource for the {saphana} scale-out cluster.

As user {refsidadm} create a file e.g. named crm-fencing.txt.

==== Cluster in Maintenance Mode

As we will load the configuration for the resources and the constraints
step-by-step to the cluster in order to explain the different parts, the
best way to avaoid unexpected cluster reactions is to first set the
complete cluster to maintenence mode, then to do all needed changes and
as last step end the cluster maintenence mode.

// DONE PRIO2: Text about that step (descriptiddve and exlain why)

----
crm configure property maintenance-mode=true

==== SAPHanaTopology
Next we define the group of resources needed, before the {saphana} instances can be
started. Prepare the changes in a text file, for example _crm-saphanatop.txt_,
and load these with the _crm_ command.

You need to change maybe the *SID* and *instance  number* (bold) to your values.

stop) are typical values to be adjusted to your environment.

==== SAPHanaController

|PREFER_SITE_TAKEOVER
|Defines whether RA should prefere to takeover to the seconadry instance instead
of restarting the failed primary locally.

|AUTOMATED_REGISTER
|Defines whether a former primary should be automatically registered to be
secondary of the new primary. With this parameter you can adapt the level of
system replication automation. level of system replication automation.

If set to false the former primary must be manually registered. The cluster will
not start this {SAPHANA} RDBMS till it is registerd to avoid double primary up
situations.

|DUPLICATE_PRIMARY_TIMEOUT
|Time difference needed between two primary time stamps, if a dual-primary
situation occurs. If the time difference is less than the time gap, than the
cluster hold one or both sites in a "WAITING" status.
This is to give a admin the chance to react on a failover. If the complete node
of the former primary crashed, the former primary will be registered after the
time difference is passed. If "only" the {SAPHANA} RDBMS has crashed, then the
former primary will be registered immediately. After this registration to the
new primary all data will be overwritten by the system replication.

=== Final Steps

==== Verify the Communication between the Hook and the Cluster

Now we could check, if the HA/DR provider was able to set the appropriate
cluster attribute hana_{refsidLC}_glob_srHook:

// DONE PRIO2: (FH) This must stay here, because crm_attribute first needs the cluster setup :)

In this case the HA/DR provider set the attribute to SFAIL to inform the
cluster about a broken system replication.

==== Using special Virtual Host Names or FQHN during installation of  {saphana}

(FQHN) instead of the short node name, the resourec agents needs to map these
names. To be able to match the short node name with the used SAP 'virtual
host name' the {sapHostAgent} needs to report the list of installed instances
correctly:

== Testing the Cluster
// DONE PRIO2: (all) Improve the wording and add some more tests

[[Testing]] Testing is one of the most important project tasks for implementing clusters.
Proper testing is crucial. Please make sure that all test cases
derived from project or customer expectations are defined and passed completely.
*Without testing the project is likely to fail in production use*.

.<<Planning>> <<OsSetup>> <<SAPHanaInst>> <<SAPHanaHsr>> <<Integration>> <<Cluster>> Testing
image::SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut-Plan-Phase7.svg[scaledwidth="100%"]

The test prerequisite, if not described differently, is always that all cluster
nodes are booted, are already normal members of the cluster and the {saphana} RDBMS
is running. The system replication is in sync represented by 'SOK'.
The cluster is idle, no actions are pending, no migration constraints left over, no failcounts left over.

In this version of the setup guide we provide a plain list of test cases. We plan to describe the
test cases more detailled in the future. Either we will provide these details in an update of this guide
or we will extract the test cases to a seperate test plan document.

=== Generic Cluster Tests

This kind of cluster tests covers the cluster reaction during operations. This includes starting and stopping
the complete cluster or simulating SBD failues and much more.

* Parallel start of all cluster nodes (systemctl start pacemaker should be done in a short time frame).
* Stop of the complete cluster.
* Isolate ONE of the two {saphana} sites.
* Power-off the majority maker.
* Isolate the SBD.
* Simulate a maintenance procedure with cluster continously running.
* Simulate a maintenance procedure with cluster restart.
// * ? Force a sr_takeover via cluster migration commands (use force!!).
* Kill the corosync process of one of the cluster nodes.

=== Tests on the Primary Site

This kind of tests are checking the reaction on several failures of the primary site.

==== Tests regarding Cluster Nodes of the Primary Site

The tests listed here check the {saphana} and cluster reaction if one or more nodes of the primary site are failing or
re-joining the cluster.

* Power-off master name server of the primary. The test assumes that there is still a {saphana} standby instance.
* Power-off master name server of the primary after all standby instances are already in use.
* Power-off any worker node but not the master name server of the primary. The test assumes that there is still a {saphana} standby instance.
* Power-off any worker node but not the master name server of the primary after all standby instances are already in use.
* Power-off any standby node of the primary.
* Re-join of a previously power-off cluster node.

==== Tests regarding the complete Primary Site

This test category is simulating a complete site failure.

* Power-off all nodes of the primary site in parallel.

==== Tests regarding the {saphana} Instances of the Primary Site

The tests listed here are checks about the {saphana} and cluster reactions triggered by application failures such as a killed {saphana} instance.

* Kill the {saphana} instance of the master name server of the primary. The test assumes that there is still a {saphana} standby instance.
* Kill the {saphana} instance of the master name server of the primary after all standby instances are already in use.
* Kill the {saphana} instance of any worker node but not the master name server of the primary. The test assumes that there is still a {saphana} standby instance.
* Kill the {saphana} instance of any worker node but not the master name server of the primary after all standby instances are already in use.
* Kill the {saphana} instance of any standby node.
* Kill sapstartrv of any {saphana} instance of the primary.

=== Tests on the Secondary Site

This kind of tests are checking the reaction on several failures of the secondary site.

==== Tests regarding Cluster Nodes of the Secondary Site

The tests listed here check the {saphana} and cluster reaction if one or more nodes of the secondary site are failing or
re-joining the cluster.

* Power-off master name server of the secondary. The test assumes that there is still a {saphana} standby instance.
* Power-off master name server of the secondary after all standby instances are already in use.
* Power-off any worker node but not the master name server of the secondary. The test assumes that there is still a {saphana} standby instance.
* Power-off any worker node but not the master name server of the secondary after all standby instances are already in use.
* Power-off any standby node of the secondary.
* Re-join of a previously power-off cluster node.

==== Tests regarding the complete Secondary Site

This test category is simulating a complete site failure.

* Power-off all nodes of the secondary site in parallel.

==== Tests regarding the {saphana} Instances of the Secondary Site

The tests listed here are checks about the {saphana} and cluster reactions triggered by application failures such as a killed {saphana} instance.

* Kill the {saphana} instance of the master name server of the secondary. The test assumes that there is still a {saphana} standby instance.
* Kill the {saphana} instance of the master name server of the secondary after all standby instances are already in use.
* Kill the {saphana} instance of any worker node but not the master name server of the secondary. The test assumes that there is still a {saphana} standby instance.
* Kill the {saphana} instance of any worker node but not the master name server of the secondary after all standby instances are already in use.
* Kill the {saphana} instance of any standby node.
* Kill sapstartrv of any {saphana} instance of the secondary.

== Administration
=== Do and Don't

In your project, you should *do*:

* Define (and test) STONITH *before* adding other resources to the cluster.
 
* Do *intensive* testing.

* *Tune* the timeouts of operations of SAPHanaController and SAPHanaTopology.

* Start with ** PREFER_SITE_TAKEOVER=true**, **AUTOMATED_REGISTER=false** and
  **DUPLICATE_PRIMARY_TIMEOUT=”7200”**.

* Always make sure that the cluster configuration does not contain any left-over
  client-prefer location constraints or failcounts.

* Before testing or beginning maintenance procedures check, if the cluster is
  in idle state.

In your project, *avoid*:

* Rapidly changing/changing back cluster configuration, such as: Setting nodes
  to standby and online again or stopping/starting the master/slave resource.

* Creating a cluster without proper time synchronization or unstable name
  resolutions for hosts, users, and groups.

* Adding location rules for the clone, master/slave or IP resource. Only
  location rules mentioned in this setup guide are allowed.

* As "migrating" or "moving" resources in crm-shell, HAWK or other tools would
  add client-prefer location rules this activities are completely *forbidden!*.

=== Monitoring and Tools
You can use the High Availability Web Konsole (HAWK), {SAPHANA} Studio and
different command line tools for cluster status requests.

==== HAWK – Cluster Status and more
You can use an internet browser to check the cluster status. Use the following url:
https://<node>:7630

////
TODO PRIO3: Discuss some disadvantages of HAWK or missing features:
S_IDLE? cs_cluterstate or crm_simulate
cli-? crm configure | grep cli
failcount? -INF?
////

The login credentials are provided during installation dialog of ha-cluster-init. Please keep in mind to
change the default password of the linux user _hacluster_ .

.Cluster Status in Hawk
image::cluster_status_hawk_1.png[scaledwidth="95%"]

If you set up the cluster using _ha-cluster-init_ and you have installed all
packages as described above, your system will provide a very useful web
interface. You can use this graphical web interface to get an overview of the
complete cluster status, doing administrative tasks or even configure resources
and cluster bootstrap parameters.

Read our product manuals for a complete documentation of this powerful user
interface.

==== {SAPHANA} Studio
Database-specific administration and checks can be done with {SAPHANA} studio.

// DONE PRIO1: (FH) picture studio landscape scale-out

.{SAPHANA} Studio – Landscape of a scale-out system
image::hana_studio_landscape.png[scaledwidth="95%"]

Please be extremely careful with changing any parameters or topology of the
system replication as it might get an interference with the cluster resource management.

A positive example would be to register a former primary as new secondary and you have
set AUTOMATED_REGISTER=false.

A negative example would be to un-register a secondary,
disable the system replication on the primary and such action.

For all actions which would change the system replication we recommend to first check
for the maintenance procedure.

==== Cluster Command-Line Tools

crm_mon::
A simple overview can be obtained by calling _crm_mon. Using option _-r_ shows
also stopped but already configured resources. Option _-1_ tells crm_mon to
output the status once instead of periodically.

See the manual page crm_mon(8) for details.

SAPHanaSR-showAttr::
To show some of the SAPHanaController and SAPHanaTopology resource agent
internal values, you can call the program _SAPHanaSR-showAttr_. The internal
values, storage place and their parameter names may change in the next versions.
The command _SAPHanaSR-showAttr_ will always fetch the values from the correct
storage place.

[IMPORTANT]
Do *not* use cluster commands like _crm_attribute_ to fetch the values directly
from the cluster, because in such cases your methods will be broken, when we
need to move an attribute to a different storage place or even out of the cluster.

For first _SAPHanaSR-showAttr_ is a test program only and should not be used for
automated system monitoring.

The tool display all interesting cluster attributes in three areas.

* The **global** section includes the information about the cib timestamp and
  the attributes covering the status of the system replication

* The **site** section includes the attributes per site and shows which site is
  the primary as well as the returncode of the landscapeHostConfiguration.py
  script. In addition the active master nameserver is shown per site.

* The **hosts** section includes the node status, the roles of the host inside the
  {saphana} database, the calculated score to get the primary master nameserver and
  the site name the host belongs to.

Following the SAP HA guideline, the SAPHana resource agent interprets the
return codes in the following way:

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
.Table Interpretation of Return Codes
|===
|Return Code
|Description

|4
|{SAPHANA} database is up and OK. The cluster does interpret this as correctly
running database.

|3
|{SAPHANA} database is up and in status INFO. The cluster does interpret this as
a correctly running database.

|2
|{SAPHANA} database is up and in status warning. The cluster does interpret this
as a correctly running database.

|1
|{SAPHANA} database is down. If the database should be up and is not own by
intention, this could trigger a takeover.

|0
|Internal Script Error – to be ignored.
